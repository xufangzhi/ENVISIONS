## 🔥 News
- [2024/07/12] 🚀 The codebase is fixed and completed ! Try it in Branch v0.2 !
- [2024/07/09] A series of [checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/Symbol-LLM/) after self-training with ENVISIONS are released at huggingface ! Cover agent, math and logic domains ! Include 7B and 13B versions ! Check it out !
- [2024/05/20] 🚀🚀🚀 ENVISIONS is under review!
- [2024/05/01] 🔥🔥🔥 We create a new repo for the code of ENVISIONS!


## 📒 Note
This work is still in progress. You can also check our previous work [Symbol-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09278) on neural-symbolism. It will appear at ACL 2024 main conference.

## 🌍 ENVISIONS: Env-guided Self-training Framework for Neural Symbolism

![model](assets/Model.png)


## 🔧 Environments
Please refer to ``requirements.txt`` to build the environment. The current version of code supports the experiments on 8*GPUs.

## 🚀 How to Start Training

To try on ENVISIONS, please use the bash script `run_self_training.sh` or directly use the following command:

For **agentic** task MiniWob, please use:
```bash
python ENVISIONS/self_training_miniwob.py --base_model "llama2chat" --model_size "7B" --task_prefix "miniwob_llama2chat" --vllm_batchsize 1
```

For **mathematical** tasks, please use:
```bash
python ENVISIONS/self_training.py --base_model "llama2chat" --model_size "7B" --task_prefix "gsm_math_full_llama2chat" --vllm_batchsize 1
```

For **logical reasoning** tasks, please use:
```bash
python ENVISIONS/self_training_logic.py --base_model "llama2chat" --model_size "7B" --task_prefix "logic_llama2chat" --vllm_batchsize 1
```

*Note: paths to the base LLM are required to be replaced with your local path of the corresponding checkpoints.

+ The LLM training is based on [open-instruct](https://github.com/allenai/open-instruct) and the generation steps are accelerated by [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm).
